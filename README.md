# ⏳ Time Dilation Calculator 🌌

## 📌 Description
The **Time Dilation Calculator** is a **web-based application** designed to compute **velocity-based and gravitational time dilation effects** using Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. The website consists of multiple calculators to help users visualize how time slows down under extreme velocities or intense gravitational fields.

This project includes:
- **Velocity-Based Time Dilation**: Calculates time dilation due to high-speed travel.
- **Gravitational Time Dilation**: Determines time differences caused by the gravity of massive celestial bodies.

## 🚀 Features
- **🛰️ Velocity-Based Time Dilation**  
  - Computes the **difference in time perception** between a moving observer and a stationary observer.  
  - Users enter **travel duration and velocity**, and the app calculates the **difference in elapsed time on Earth**.  
  - Provides real-world **comparisons** (e.g., multiples of airplane speed, Artemis I rocket speed, fastest spacecraft speed).  
  - Estimates the **year in which such speeds will be achievable** based on historical trends.

- **🌍 Gravitational Time Dilation**  
  - Computes the **rate of time passage on a planet** relative to Earth.  
  - Users enter **planetary mass and radius**, and the app calculates the **time shift per second** due to gravitational effects.  
  - Explains how stronger gravitational fields **slow down time** for an observer.  

- **🔢 Scientific Calculations**  
  - Uses **Einstein’s general and special relativity equations** to provide **accurate** time dilation estimates.  
  - Implements **mathematical precision with real-world astronomical constants**.  

- **🖥️ Interactive UI**  
  - Developed with **Bootstrap 5** for responsive navigation.  
  - **Dynamic input fields** with instant calculations.
